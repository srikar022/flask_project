<p>Direct marketing is the sale of agricultural goods and products from the farm straight to the consumer,without intervening distributors or retailers.Direct marketing can benefit farmers by allowing them to earn a greater portion of the consumer food dollar by eliminating intermediary brokers,buyers,and distributors. Examples of direct marketing include community supported agriculture (CSA) ventures, farmers markets and farm stands,and direct sale to businesses and institutions, such as restaurants,schools or hospitals.Direct marketing can contribute toward sustainable agriculture and food systems by increasing farmer profitability,promoting the local economy,and providing consumers with higher quality and healthier products.</p>  
<p>Prior to the widespread availability of refrigeration,many farmers were responsible for their own marketing.Sales were generally made directly to retail stores,or to customers at farm stands and street markets.The development of refrigeration, efficient transportation,and large supermarkets in the 1940â€™s caused many farmers to shift away from the responsibility of marketing and selling their own products.Farmers began developing contracts with wholesale buyers so they could focus on increasing the scale of production.Farmers also began to specialize in just one or a limited number of products so as to be able to supply enough quantity for wholesale level demand.The wholesale contract model generally involves an intermediary customer who re-sells or distributes produce to retail outlets or other wholesale markets.This introduces an additional transaction point before the product reaches an end consumer.</p>
<p>The Farmer-to-Consumer Direct Marketing Act of 1976 led to a resurgence in direct marketing by farmers.The act was a national attempt to encourage direct marketing and revitalize local food and agricultural economies.In 1977,the California Department of Food and Agriculture enacted further regulations that exempted farmers from certain packaging,sizing,and labeling requirements for fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts sold directly to consumers.The state also established Certified Farmers Markets,where the only products available are grown by farmers at the market,who have been certified through the county agricultural commissioner.</p>
